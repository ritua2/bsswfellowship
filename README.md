## BSSw Fellowship
This repository contains the deliverables associated with my BSSw Fellowship.

Note: The PDF file named "optimizing_IO_part1_part2_part3_combined_updated.pdf" contains 100 pages and have been moved to the documents folder. Please feel free to click on "More Pages" if you are opening this document on GitHub and scrolling down.

As a part of my fellowship, I created videos, articles/blogs, and examples/exercises to demonstrate how to optimize I/O in scientific applications including the applications from the area of AI/machine learning and have delivered a 3-day tutorial on these topics. Specifically, I have covered the following topics:
(1) Optimizing I/O in serial and parallel applications
(2) Optimally writing and reading checkpoints in serial and parallel applications
(3) Optimizing I/O and checkpointing AI/machine learning models/applications
(4) Techniques for leveraging the features in the underlying hardware and filesystems (e.g., Lustre) for optimizing applicationsâ€™ I/O while being aware of portability issues.
