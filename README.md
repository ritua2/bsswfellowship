## BSSw Fellowship
This repository contains the deliverables associated with my BSSw Fellowship.

Note: The PDF file named "optimizing_IO_part1_part2_part3_combined_updated.pdf" contains 100 pages and has been moved to the documents folder. Please feel free to click on "More Pages" if you are opening this document on GitHub and scrolling down.

As a part of my fellowship, I created videos, articles/blogs, and examples/exercises to demonstrate how to optimize I/O in scientific applications including the applications from the area of AI/machine learning and have delivered a 3-part tutorial on these topics. Specifically, I have covered the following topics:
(1) Optimizing I/O in serial and parallel applications
(2) Optimally writing and reading checkpoints in serial and parallel applications
(3) Optimizing I/O and checkpointing AI/machine learning models/applications
(4) Techniques for leveraging the features in the underlying hardware and filesystems (e.g., Lustre) for optimizing applicationsâ€™ I/O while being aware of portability issues.

## Using this Repository
The code shared through this repository is released under the LGPL-2.1 license. The presentation slides are released under the CC BY-NC 2.0 license.

The content included in this repository is meant to be an anthology of the different strategies to address the optimization of I/O in serial and parallel applications from the hardware to the software level. The wide breadth of the content covered includes topics such as optimal programming language/library functions for doing I/O, using an optimal data transfer protocol, efficiently leveraging the parallel and distributed filesystems and the storage hardware, creating job dependencies for setting up automated workflows for checkpointing-and-restart (which is a critical piece due to the amount of I/O it involves), and leveraging the features of the machine learning/AI frameworks for doing I/O optimally. 

If you would like to learn about the topic of Optimizing I/O in the tutorial mode, then please refer to the slides at the following link: https://github.com/ritua2/bsswfellowship/blob/main/documents/optimizing_IO_part1_part2_part3_combined.pdf . The content in these slides is divided into three parts, and you should be able to start with any part at any point in time as long as the prerequisites are met. These parts are as follows:

Part-1: (1) Strategies and practices for reducing inefficient I/O in serial and parallel applications, including AI frameworks, and (2) Introduction to Parallel Filesystems (Lustre)

Part-2: Reading and writing files in parallel using MPI

Part-3: Checkpointing serial and parallel applications

The links to the videos of the different parts of the tutorial are included in the videos folder.
