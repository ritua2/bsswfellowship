This directory contains the code for demonstrating application-level checkpointing in C, C++, MPI, Python, and R code. Checkpointing (or Saving and Restart) in AI/machine learning models (developed using PyTorch and TensorFlow) is also demonstrated.  The steps for compiling and running these code samples are shared in their separate README files that are also added to this folder. 

These code samples go along with the "Optimizing I/O" tutorial and the articles written on checkpointing.
