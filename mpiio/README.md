This directory contains sample code for reading and writing in parallel using MPI IO as well as the code and solutions for the exercises used in the "Optimizing I/O" tutorial.

The "basicmpi" directory provides a "hello world" MPI code that can be used to test the platform/software stack availability before running the MPI I/O code in the "C" directory. The "C" directory contains the majority of the code that goes with the MPI I/O exmaples in the "Optimizing IO slides".
